- Use Gmail's font size dropdown to set to "Normal" or "Small"
- Avoid using "Increase/Decrease font size" buttons

**Logo doesn't appear:**
- Ensure you're connected to internet when setting up
- Try refreshing Gmail settings page
- Re-paste the signature if needed

**Signature doesn't auto-appear:**
- Check that signature is selected in "Signature defaults"
- Verify "Insert signature before quoted text" is checked
- Try creating a new signature entry

### For IT Support
If team members have issues, the signature uses a hosted logo at:
`[YOUR_DOMAIN]/api/logo/bwa-30th.png`

This ensures consistent branding across all team signatures.
